- arith.cl: Tests various aspects of arithmetic in Cool.
- atoi.cl: An implementation of the C function by thesame name. It converts a String into an Int.
- atoi_test.cl: An example program using atoi.cl. Since youwill most likely use atoi.cl in the firstassignment, you should study this example.
- list.cl: A very simple program showing how to create alist data type for integers. It illustratesinheritance and dynamic dispatch.
- book_list.cl: Illustrates inheritance and in particular themechanism of STATIC DISPATCH and the CASEstatement.
- cells.cl: Models a one-dimensional cellular automaton.
- cool.cl: An short and obscure program.
- io.cl: Shows how to use the IO class. (input/output)
- hairyscary.cl: Exercises many of the obscure features of thelanguage in obscure ways.
- hello_world.cl: The classic first program.
- primes.cl: An unusual prime number generator.
- graph.cl: A program reading descriptions of weighted-directed graphs from stdin in text format.
- g1.graph: A sample input to graph.cl
- palindrome.cl: Recognizes palindromes.
- complex.cl: Checks the = operator and cummulative effects ofmethod calls via a complex number object.
- life.cl: The classic Game of Life
- sort_list.cl: A more complex example sorting lists of integers.
